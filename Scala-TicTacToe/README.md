`$ scalac Main.scala Board.scala`

### How to Play?

a tic tac toe board will be print on screen and
the system will ask the players to insert a valid
position to place "X's" or "O's".
if the position entered is valid, a new board will
be printed with the selected field occupied by the "X" or the "O".
This will continue until one of the players manages to
draw 3 consecutive "X's" or "O's" in line, or diagonally
which will consist on a win and the game will restart, or
if all the positions of the board are occupied and there's
no winner, the game will declare a tie (draw), and restart the game.
